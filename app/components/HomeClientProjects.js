              Over the course of my freelance work, I&apos;ve successfully
              delivered a variety of projects for clients, each with its own
              unique requirements:
            </h3>
            <ul className="grid gap-3 p-2">

                <h4 className="text-lg max-sm:text-sm">Landing Pages:</h4>
                <p className="max-sm:text-xs">
                  I developed two landing pagesâ€”one using HTML, CSS, and
                  JavaScript, and another using React with component-based
                  styling. Both projects were designed to be responsive and
                  visually engaging, providing my clients with user-friendly,
                  conversion-focused pages.

                <p className="max-sm:text-xs">
                  I built a comprehensive website with multiple subpages, using
                  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus was on clarity, ease of
                  navigation, and delivering a professional appearance for the
                  client&apos;s business needs.

                </h4>
                <p className="max-sm:text-xs">
                  I created a full-stack website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS,
                  which included a fully integrated blog with a CMS. This allows
                  my client to easily add and manage articles. I used Supabase
                  to manage the backend and handle API requests, ensuring a
                  smooth and scalable system.
